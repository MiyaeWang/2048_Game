    This game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid board, with numbered tiles that
    slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.Every turn,
    a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with
    a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen
    direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the
    grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge
    into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.
