# 2048_Game
A course final project. Written in Python.

2048 is a single-player game. It is played on a 4 times 4 grid board. 

At the beginning, there are two numbers, 2 or 4. The player slide in any direction, left, right, up or down. Then all numbers will be moved in the chosen direction. If the value of one spot is identical with the value next to it, the two numbers will be merged to one number. If three consecutive spots are the same value, only the first two spots will be merged. If four consecutive spots are the same value, the first two and the last two spots will be merged respectively. Meanwhile, a new number will be generated in an empty spot each time you slide the numbers.

The game is won when a value of 2048 appears on the board. When the player has no moves, which means there are no empty spaces and no adjacent spots with the same value, the game ends.
